## Introduction 
* MojoLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android based on [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher)
* This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions ranging from rd-132211 to 1.21 snapshots (including Combat Test versions). 
* Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported. 

## Getting MojoLauncher

You can get MojoLauncher via three methods:

1. You can get the prebuilt app from [automatic builds](https://github.com/MojoLauncher/MojoLauncher/actions).

2. You can get it from Google Play by clicking on this badge:
[![Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=git.artdeell.mojo)

3. You can [build](#building) from source.
## Building   
* Build the launcher (it will automatically download all required components)
```
./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug
```
(Replace `./gradlew` with `.\gradlew.bat` if you are building on Windows).

## Current roadmap
- [x] Instance system in favor of profiles
- [x] Out-of-the box 1.21.5 support
- [ ] LTW: resolve issues with Create
- [ ] LTW: enable compute shader/image extensions
- [ ] LTW: switch to a color-renderable format for framebuffers
- [ ] Modpack/mod management tool
- [ ] mrpack/CurseForge zip import
- [ ] MMC-compatible instance import
- [ ] Patch-on-dlopen for mod native libraries
- [ ] Replace Holy-GL4ES 1.1.5 with KW (maybe? need to figure out requirements)

## Known Issues
- Some physical mice may have very slow mouse speed
- On Holy GL4ES, large texture atlases may be distorted (resulting in stretched/blocky textures in modpacks)
- Probably more, that's why we have a bug tracker ;)
